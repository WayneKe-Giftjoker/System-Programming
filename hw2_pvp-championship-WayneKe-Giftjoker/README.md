## 1. Problem Description <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/blue_book.png" alt=":blue_book:" style="zoom:33%;" />

For you and TA to save our time reading/writing a story for this homework, let‚Äôs make the long story short. <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/clown_face.png" alt=":clown_face:" style="zoom:33%;" />

There are 8 players (P0 - P7) in this championship. We use a simpler [Double Elimination Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-elimination_tournament) for this championship. Each battle has only two players, so there are 14 battles(A - N) in total to generate a champion.

In this homework, **you have to finish such a championship by writing 2 programs(battle.c and player.c)**. You don‚Äôt have to customize your championship. Just follow the picture above to finish your programs.

## 2. Implementation & Specs <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/bulb.png" alt=":bulb:" style="zoom:33%;" />

- Please strictly follow the implementation guidelines as follows.
- Some details may be omitted on purpose below. Try your best to ensure your program runs smoothly.
- For all battles and players processes, they have to write down logs to their log files when they pass/receive the [PSSM](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Player-Status-Structured-Message-PSSM) to/from parents, children, or siblings.

### 2.1 battle.c <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/crossed_swords.png" alt=":crossed_swords:" style="zoom:33%;" />

- The compiled executables must be named `battle`.

- Running the program in [Battle Exec Format](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Battle-Exec-Format).

- There will be **14** battles (from A to N) in the game, a battle starts whenever two players both send the first [PSSM](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Player-Status-Structured-Message-PSSM) to the battle, so different battles may run parallelly.

- For non-root battles (B - N), it should read from its parent via **stdin**, and write to its parent via **stdout**.

- For the root battle (A), it should print the [Champion Message](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Champion-Message) via **stdout** when the battle ends.

- For battles (A - N), it should communicate with its two children via **pipes**. Two pipes should be created for each child. One for writing to the child. The other for reading from the child. So **a battle will create four pipes in total**.

- **Four modes** in a battle‚Äôs lifecycle:

  - Init Mode
    - In this mode, battle creates its log file, create pipes, fork children‚Ä¶, etc. Then it enters Waiting Mode.
  - Waiting Mode
    - After the battle initializes itself, it enters Waiting Mode. It is blocked by the pipes until it receives PSSMs from both children.
  - Playing Mode
    - In Playing Mode, the battle receives children‚Äôs PSSM, updates them, then sends them back to each children repeatedly until one of the player‚Äôs HP ‚â§0‚â§0.
  - Passing Mode
    - In Passing Mode, the battle is responsible for passing PSSM between its parent and child. The passing mode ends when all its descendant players‚Äô HP ‚â§0‚â§0. After that, **the battle should terminate itself immediately**.

- Log File

  - Please checkout [here](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Log-Format) first for general log format.

  - Each battle creates a log file named

    ```
    log_battle[battle_id].txt
    ```

    - battle_id: the battle‚Äôs ID
      - Valid Format: letter A - N (with upper case)
    - Example: `log_battleG.txt`

  - There are 

    two scenarios

     that a battle needs to 

    append

     the message to the log file

    1. Right after

        the battle receives PSSM from the target (parent / child).

       > You should guarantee that the log content is the same as the value in PSSM before/after an IPC.

       - Format:

         ```
         [self's ID],[self's pid] pipe from [target's ID],[target's pid] [real_player_id],[HP],[current_battle_id],[battle_ended_flag]\n
         ```

       - Example:

         ```
         G,1006 pipe from 0,2000 0,3,G,0\n
         ```

    2. Right before the battle sends PSSM to the target (parent / child).

       - Format:

         ```
         [self's ID],[self's pid] pipe to [target's ID],[target's pid] [real_player_id],[HP],[current_battle_id],[battle_ended_flag]\n
         ```

       - Example:

         ```
         G,1006 pipe to 0,2000 0,3,G,0\n
         ```

- Implementation: (in order)

  1. Create the log file.
  2. Fork and exec two children, then wait for [PSSMs](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Player-Status-Structured-Message-PSSM) from both of them.
  3. Receive two childrens‚Äô statuses in the form of PSSM.
  4. Two players perform [a round of the battle](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Battle-Rules).
  5. Check if Playing Mode is finished, then send two PSSMs back to each children respectively.
     - If Playing Mode is not finished, repeat the step 3 to 5.
     - Otherwise, after sending the last PSSMs to both children, the battle wait for the loser child‚Äôs death, then change to Passing Mode.
  6. In Passing Mode, the battle still receive winner child‚Äôs PSSM, but instead of updating the status by itself, it just pass the PSSM to its parent, then wait for the response from it. For everytime the parent pass the PSSM back, the battle should check if the descendant player is dead.
     - If not, passes the PSSM to its child.
     - Otherwise, it pass the last PSSM to its child, wait for its death, then kill itself immediately.

### 2.2 player.c <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/guardsman.png" alt=":guardsman:" style="zoom:33%;" />

- The compiled executables must be named `player`.

- Running the program in [Player Exec Format](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Player-Exec-Format).

- For each player, it should read from its parent via **stdin**, and write to its parent via **stdout**.

- Two types of players

  - Real Player (P0 - P7)
    - It reads initial status from **player_status.txt** and join battles first. When the Real Player lose in a battle, it will transfer its PSSM to the corresponding Agent Player via **fifo**.
  - Agent Player (P8 - P14)
    - It waits for a PSSM via fifo in the beginning. After receiving loser‚Äôs PSSM from the corresponding battle, the Agent Player then works like a Real Player.

- Log File

  - Please checkout [here](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Log-Format) first for general log format.

  - Each Real Player creates a log file named

    ```
    log_player[player_id].txt
    ```

    - player_id: Real Player‚Äôs ID
      - Valid Format: integer, 0‚â§0‚â§ player_id ‚â§7‚â§7
    - Example: `log_player0.txt`

  - For Agent players, they inherit the Real Player‚Äôs log file and continue to append logs to the same log file.

  - There are 

    four scenarios

     that a player needs to append the message to the log file:

    1. Right after the player receives PSSM from the target (parent).

       - Format:

         ```
         [self's ID],[self's pid] pipe from [target's ID],[parent's pid] [real_player_id],[HP],[current_battle_id],[battle_ended_flag]\n
         ```

       - Example:

         ```
         0,2000 pipe from G,1006 0,3,G,0\n
         ```

    2. Right before the player sends PSSM to the target (parent).

       - Format:

         ```
         [self's ID],[self's pid] pipe to [target's ID],[target's pid] [real_player_id],[HP],[current_battle_id],[battle_ended_flag]\n
         ```

       - Example:

         ```
         0,2000 pipe to G,1006 0,3,G,0\n
         ```

    3. Right before the 

       Real Player

        sends PSSM to the target (agent player). 

       (Notice that this log format is slightly different to others)

       - Format:

         ```
         [self's ID],[self's pid] fifo to [target's id] [real_player_id],[HP]\n
         ```

       - Example:

         ```
         0,2000 fifo to 8 0,3\n
         ```

    4. Right after the 

       Agent Player

        receives PSSM from the target (real player). 

       (Notice that this log format is slightly different to others)

       - Format:

         ```
         [self's ID],[self's pid] fifo from [target's id] [real_player_id],[HP]\n
         ```

       - Example:

         ```
         8,2007 fifo from 0 0,3\n
         ```

- Implementation: (in order)

  1. Check if the player is a Real Player or an Agent Player by args.

     - Create a fifo named:

       ```
       player[K].fifo
       ```

       - K: Agent Player‚Äôs ID
         - Valid Format: integer, 8‚â§K‚â§148‚â§K‚â§14
       - Example: `player8.fifo`
       - Either Real players or Agent players can create the fifo file. For more infomation, please check [here](https://github.com/NTU-SP/SP_HW2_release/discussions/12). **[11/11 updated]**

     - If it‚Äôs 

       Real Player

        (P0 - P7):

       - Read the player‚Äôs initial status from **player_status.txt**. A sample file is [here](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#player_statustxt). Then create PSSM from the file.

     - If it‚Äôs 

       Agent Player

        (P8 - P14):

       - Block at reading until someone writes a PSSM to the fifo.

  2. Send the PSSM to its parent.

  3. Receive the updated status from parent. Check if 

     ```
     battle_ended_flag = 1
     ```

     .

     - If not, repeat the step 2 and 3.

     - Otherwise,

       - If it‚Äôs a winner:

         - Recover itself with 

           half blood

           . (If it‚Äôs not an integer after recovering, round down it to an integer.)

           - Example: P0‚Äôs **initial HP from `player_status.txt`** is 7. After Battle G, P0‚Äôs HP = 4, so we recover half of its HP to 5 by the formula: `5(after recover) = 4(before recover) + ( 7(initial HP) - 4(before recover) ) // 2`

       - If it‚Äôs a loser in Zone A:

         - Recover itself with 

           full blood

           .

           - Example: P1‚Äôs initial HP from `player_status.txt` is 8. After Battle G, P0‚Äôs HP = 0, so we recover full of its HP to 8.

         - Write the PSSM to the Agent Player corresponds to `current_battle_id` by **fifo**.

         - Exit itself.

       - If it‚Äôs a loser in Zone B:

         - No more chances for the player.
         - Exit itself.

## 3. Several Definitions <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/pencil.png" alt=":pencil:" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Battle Exec Format

```
./battle [battle_id] [parent_pid]
```

- It requires 

  two

   arguments

  - battle_id: the id of the battle

    - Valid Format: letter A - N (with upper case)

  - parent_pid: the pid of the parent battle, 

    if there is no parent battle (root battle A), then parent_pid = 0

    - Valid Format: Non-negative integer

### Player Exec Format

```
./player [player_id] [parent_pid]
```

- It requires 

  two

   arguments

  - player_id: the id of the player
    - Valid Format: integer, 0‚â§0‚â§ player_id ‚â§14‚â§14
  - parent_pid: the pid of the parent battle.
    - Valid Format: Non-negative integer

### Champion Message

```
Champion is P[player_id]\n
```

- player_id: the ID of the player
  - Valid Format: 0 - 7. Note that **if the champion is an Agent Player, it should print the original Real Player‚Äôs ID** that is inherited by the Agent Player.
  - Example: `Champion is P0\n`

### Player Status Structured Message (PSSM)

A structure to pass between processes. **You cannot modify the structure by yourself**, or TA‚Äôs program may not work fine with your program.

```
typedef enum {
    FIRE,
    GRASS,
    WATER
} Attribute;

typedef struct {
    int real_player_id; // ID of the Real Player, an integer from 0 - 7
    int HP; // Healthy Point
    int ATK; // Attack Power
    Attribure attr; // Player's attribute
    char current_battle_id; //current battle ID
    int battle_ended_flag; // a flag for validate if the battle is the last round or not, 1 for yes, 0 for no
} Status;
```

Here we give you some hints about PSSM:

1. You will not modify **real_player_id, ATK and attr** after the PSSM‚Äôs creation by real players. You can see them as **const variables**.
2. Only `battles` will modify the value of `current_battle_id`.
3. Only `battles` will modify the value of `battle_ended_flag` from 0 to 1.
4. Only `players` will modify the value of `battle_ended_flag` from 1 to 0.

### Log Format

- It‚Äôs because that we can‚Äôt know what data you pass between processes when we test your programs, so we need you to **write logs before/after all IPCs**. It‚Äôs also helpful for you to debug your programs via these log files.

- There will be 8 + 14 log files in the championship. 8 for real players, 14 for battles.

- To sum up log formats for battles and players,

  ```
  [self's info] ["pipe"/"fifo"] ["from"/"to"] [target's info] [PSSM contents]\n
  ```

  - There are 

    5 main arguments

     in the log format. Main arguments are splitted by a space character " ". Each main argument may have several sub-arguments. Sub-arguments are splitted by a comma character ‚Äú,‚Äù.

    - self‚Äôs info: 2 sub-arguments (self‚Äôs ID, self‚Äôs PID)

      - self‚Äôs ID: self‚Äôs ID in this championship

        - Valid Format: letter A-N (with upper case) or number 0-14

      - self‚Äôs PID: self‚Äôs process ID (can use 

        ```
        getpid()
        ```

         system call to reach it)

        - Valid Format: a positive integer

    - ‚Äúpipe‚Äù/‚Äúfifo‚Äù: communication type, 1 sub-argument

      - ‚Äúpipe‚Äù for communicates between parents or childs
      - ‚Äúfifo‚Äù for communicates between siblings.

    - ‚Äúfrom‚Äù/‚Äúto‚Äù: communication direction, 1 sub-argument

      - ‚Äúfrom‚Äù: A message received from the other process.
      - ‚Äúto‚Äù: A message sent to the other process.

    - target‚Äôs info: the other process‚Äôs info, 1 or 2 sub-arguments (target‚Äôs ID, target‚Äôs PID)

      - target‚Äôs ID: parent/child/slibling‚Äôs ID in this championship

        - Valid Format: letter A-N (with upper case) or number 0-14

      - target‚Äôs PID: parent/child‚Äôs process ID, 

        you don‚Äôt need this argument when IPC with siblings, because you have no chance to get its pid

        .

        - Valid Format: a positive integer

    - PSSM contents: the PSSM you pass in IPC, 2 or 4 sub-arguments (real_player_id, HP, current_battle_id, battle_ended_flag)

      - real_player_id: the value of 

        ```
        real_player_id
        ```

         in the PSSM

        - Valid Format: number 0-7

      - HP: the value of 

        ```
        HP
        ```

         in the PSSM

        - Valid Format: integer

      - current_battle_id: the value of 

        ```
        current_battle_id
        ```

         in the PSSM. 

        you don‚Äôt need this argument when IPC with siblings

        - Valid Format: letter A-N (with upper case)

      - battle_ended_flag: the value of 

        ```
        battle_ended_flag
        ```

         in the PSSM. 

        you don‚Äôt need this argument when IPC with siblings

        - Valid Format: 0 or 1

### Zone A / B

For battles in **Zone A**, players who lose in the battle still have a chance to be the champion, however, players who lose in the battle in **Zone B** are eliminated.

### Battle Rules

- Each battle contains N rounds (N‚â•1N‚â•1) to generate a winner/loser.
- For each round, two players both attack each other once. So there are **two attacks in one round**.
- The player who has **lower HP can attack first**. If their HP are the same, the player who has lower **Real Player ID** starts first.
- **Once one of the player‚Äôs HP ‚â§0‚â§0, the round is terminated immediately**, and the battle is finished, too. So there is no chance that two players‚Äôs HP are both ‚â§0‚â§0 in a round.
- If two players‚Äô HP are both still ‚â•0‚â•0, the battle has to return PSSMs to players, wait for them to send back, and play the next round until one of the player‚Äôs HP ‚â§0‚â§0.
- Before each round starts, the battle should set two PSSM‚Äôs `current_battle_id = the battle's ID`.
- If it is the last round in this battle, you should set `battle_ended_flag = 1` in **both** PSSMs to tell two players the battle has been finished. Otherwise, the flag should be 0.
- Check if any player‚Äôs attribute matches the battle‚Äôs attribute. **If they are the same, the player‚Äôs attack power(ATK) is doubled** in this battle.
- One Attack Power(ATK) can reduce the opponent‚Äôs one Healthy Point(HP).
- Here we give an example:
  - player 0:
    - ATK: 2
    - HP: 7
    - Attribute: FIRE
  - player 1:
    - ATK: 3
    - HP: 8
    - Attribute: GRASS
  - battle G:
    - Attribute: FIRE
  - Flow:
    1. Battle G receives two PSSMs from P0 and P1.
    2. Battle G sets two PSSMs‚Äô `current_battle_id = 'G'`. **Round 1 starts.**
    3. attrP0=attrGattrP0=attrG. So **ATKP0ATKP0 is doubled** from 2 to 4.
    4. HPP0<HPP1HPP0<HPP1, P0 attacks first. 4(P1's after HP)=8(P1's before HP)‚àí4(P0's ATK)4(P1's after HP)=8(P1's before HP)‚àí4(P0's ATK)
    5. P1 attacks second. 4(P0's after HP)=7(P0's before HP)‚àí3(P1's ATK)4(P0's after HP)=7(P0's before HP)‚àí3(P1's ATK)
    6. Two players are still alive, so Battle G sets `battle_ended_flag = 0` for both PSSMs, then sends back two updated PSSMs. **Round 1 ends.**
    7. Battle G receives two PSSMs from P0 and P1.
    8. Battle G sets two PSSMs‚Äô `current_battle_id = 'G'`. **Round 2 starts.**
    9. attrP0=attrGattrP0=attrG. So **ATKP0ATKP0 is doubled** from 2 to 4.
    10. HPP0=HPP1HPP0=HPP1, but 0(P0's Real player ID)<1(P1's Real player ID)0(P0's Real player ID)<1(P1's Real player ID), so P0 attacks first. 0(P1's after HP)=4(P1's before HP)‚àí4(P0's ATK)0(P1's after HP)=4(P1's before HP)‚àí4(P0's ATK)
    11. HPP1‚â§0HPP1‚â§0, so the battle ends immediately. P0 wins/P1 loses this battle. Battle G sets `battle_ended_flag = 1` for both PSSMs, then sends back two updated PSSMs. **Round 2 ends. The battle ends, too.**

## 4. Sample Execution <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/see_no_evil.png" alt=":see_no_evil:" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Input

#### player_status.txt

This file would be the same directory with two executables in our test case. There are 8 lines in this file. **The i th line represents player (i-1)'s initial status**. For each line, there are three items, which **represents the player‚Äôs HP, ATK, Attribute, current_battle_id, battle_ended_flag** respectively (in order). The items are splitted by a space character.

There will be five arguments in a line, no invalid input exists in out testcases.

```

### Sample Executables: battle / player

We provide two sample executables named `battle` and `player` for you to test with your program. Note that it does not mean you can get full points by successfully running with these two programs. We will check if you strictly follow the steps by checking the log files step by step.

### Output

1. A [champion message](https://hackmd.io/@UTGhost/H1Nk8CpMi#Champion-Message) from battle A‚Äôs stdout at the end of the championship.
2. 8 + 14 log files.

### For PPT sample execution, please refer to the [video](https://youtu.be/mNVUvgWQezA?t=1595).

## 5. Grading <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/100.png" alt=":100:" style="zoom:33%;" />

### **Warning** <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/warning.png" alt=":warning:" style="zoom:33%;" />

- Please strictly follow the implementation guidelines, or TA‚Äôs program may not work successfully with yours and you will lose points.

- Make sure to be aware of your programs when you are writing this homework on CSIE workstations. We encourage you to make attempts; however, if you do the following behaviors, you will lose points in this homework:

  - Leave too many zombie processes on the workstation

    . (

    OK with first time, -2 points for the rest of each times

    )

    - Each user in CSIE workstation can create at most 512 processes. If you use all the quota, you may have problems with creating login session in workstation. To solve this problem, you have to contact `ta217@csie.ntu.edu.tw`. **Please be careful!**

  - Utilize too many CPU resources by doing a busy waiting task for a long time.

    - Watch out and clean your zombie processes regularly, if you leave them in a while loop for over 24 hours, TA217 / SP TAs will notify you first. If you don‚Äôt take any actions, you will lose 2 points each time.

  - Do damages maliciously on CSIE workstations.

    - We will give you a ZERO.

  - Here‚Äôs a useful command to clean all your processes on CSIE workstations (include your terminal):

    ```
    pkill -9 -f [Your_Student_ID]
    ```

    - Your_Student_ID: Your student ID with lowercase.
    - Example: `pkill -9 -f r11922002`

- Also, we encourage you to write and debug your homework diversely on linux2 ~ linux15 and only do the final test on linux1, since their environments are almost the same.

- Please strictly follow the output format above, or you will lose the point of each task, respectively.

### Items <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/pushpin.png" alt=":pushpin:" style="zoom:33%;" />

   - (

     1.5 points

     ) Battles in Zone A, B work successfully.

     - fifo communication is correct.

   - We will test if your `player.c` could successfully communicate with TA‚Äôs `battle.c` and outputs correct log files.

   - Work successfully

      means that

     - all log files are correct
     - players terminate themselves immediately after they die.
     - work fine with TA‚Äôs battle.c.

3. (*1 points*) *Your own `battle.c` and `player.c` work together smoothly*.

   - We will test if your own program can run on its own and outputs the correct champion and log files.

4. (*1 points*) Report Questions

5. If you don‚Äôt wait your zombie processes, your maximum score in this homework will be no higher than **6 points**.

## 6. Report Question

For report questions, please write down your answer and submit the file **in PDF format** to NTUCOOL. The deadline is the same as the programming part.

### 1.

Please briefly tell us what bugs do you encounter during writing this homework. If no, tell us the most challenging part in this homework. (0.4pt)

### 2.

In this homework, you have to implement a fifo between two processes. Please tell us how you implement it in your code. Is your implementation good enough to prevent dead lock / race condition / busy waiting? If no, what is the better way to do it? (0.3pt)

### 3.

In this homework, we use fifo to communicate between real players and agent players. Is it possible to implement the communication with pipe instead of fifo? Why or Why not? Please briefly explain your answer. (0.3pt)

## 7. Submission üìÉ

### 7.1 To GitHub

Your source code should be submitted to GitHub before deadline. The submission should include at least three files:

- Makefile
- battle.c
- player.c
- other .c, .h files

The submission should not include files belows:

- log files
- executables generated by your `make` command
- fifo files

You can submit other .c, .h files, as long as they can be compiled into two executable files named `battle` and `player` with Makefile. TA will clone your repository and test your code with last commit before deadline on main branch, which is the default branch of GitHub.

Furthermore, TAs will test your code on `linux1.csie.ntu.edu.tw`, so make sure your codes will work as expected on this server. If you print some debugging messages in server, it‚Äôs suggested that you comment these debugging messages out, otherwise it may slow down your code and thus failing to pass testdata.

Last but not least,

- Do not submit unnecessary files. You should make clean before you submit.
- Github classroom seems to have a problem that we can‚Äôt record your last commit before deadline. Therefore, TA has to clone your github repo manually after the deadline (11/18 23:59). **You should not do any operation on your github repo at (11/19 00:00 - 01:00).** Or we cannot guarantee that your repo is at the right commit.

### 7.2 To NTU COOL

Your report should be submitted to NTU COOL before deadline.

## 8. Where to Ask Questions (with recommended order) <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/question.png" alt=":question:" style="zoom:33%;" />

1. Evoke QAs in Github discussion 

   NTU-SP/SP_HW2_release

   - For this homework, we **change the asking space from Github Issue to Github Discussion**.
   - [How to open a Github Discussion](https://youtu.be/rgCMmg9lBNw?t=210)

2. Send mails to 

   ```
   ntusp2022@gmail.com
   ```

   .

   - Before sending mails, please make sure that you have **read the SPEC carefully**, and **no similar questions were asked** in the discussion space, or TAs will be very tired and upset. <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/upside_down_face.png" alt=":upside_down_face:" style="zoom:33%;" />

   - **How to send an Email properly**

     - Mail title should be like: `[SP Programming HW2] TA hour reservation`
     - It‚Äôs better to use your `@ntu.edu.tw`, `@g.ntu.edu.tw`, `@csie.ntu.edu.tw` email accounts to send the mail.
     - You should write down your student ID, name at the end of the mail.
     - Please mind your manners.
     - Use punctuation marks to make your email easier to read.
     - If you want to ask questions about code in mail, please tell us how to reproduce your problem. Attach a screenshot, a video recording, or your code file will be better for us to understand your situation.
     - Below is an example format:

     ```
     Title: [SP Programming HW2] TA hour reservation
     Sent By: r11922002@csie.ntu.edu.tw
     Contents:
         Dear SP TAs,
         
         Can I have a TA hour appointment at Tuesday 13:00 - 14:00?
         I encounter some problems about fork/exec. Thank you!
     
         Best,
         R11922002 Ë≥áÂ∑•Á¢©‰∏Ä ÊùéÂÆ•ÈúÜ
     ```

   - If you don‚Äôt follow the upper rules, we may ignore your email. (Most of you guys are good, though.<img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/slightly_smiling_face.png" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" style="zoom:33%;" />)

3. Ask during TA hours

   - Belows are TA hours for this Programming Assignment. Please make appointments by email 

     ```
     ntusp2022@gmail.com
     ```

      before visiting.

     - Tuesday 13:00 - 14:00 at Room 404, CSIE building
     - Wednesday 17:30 - 18:30 at Room 302, CSIE building
     - Friday 15:00 - 16:00 at Room 404, CSIE building

## 9. Reminders <img src="https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/bangbang.png" alt=":bangbang:" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- You have to do `fflush()` or `setbuf(NULL)` if you use `printf()` to write to the pipe/fifo.
- Plagiarism is STRICTLY prohibited.
- Late policy (D refers to formal deadline, 11/18)
  - If you submit your assignment on D+1 or D+2, your score will be multiplied by 0.85.
  - If you submit your assignment between D+3 and D+5, your score will be multiplied by 0.7.
  - If you submit your assignment between D+6 and 11/30, your score will be multiplied by 0.5.
  - Late submission after 11/30 will not be accepted.

- It‚Äôs suggested that you should check return value of system calls like fork, execl, etc.
- Reading manuals of system calls may be tedious, but it‚Äôs definitely helpful.
- The sample executables are compiled on the CSIE workstation. Therefore, it should only be able to run on Linux Machines. (Note: the sample executables are used to help you and you are not required to use it.)

## How to exec sample execution
In order to testing your player with TA's battle or testing your battle with TA's player, we provide the compiled executable file for battle.c and player.c.

Put the **player_status.txt**, **battle** and **player** in your current working dir. After that, you can run TA‚Äôs battle and player with following command:  
`$ ./battle A 0`  
`A = root's [battle_id] `  
`0 = root's [parent_pid]`  
**Remember to remove all player[K].fifo(8<=K<=14) files before you execute** `$ ./battle A 0` **otherwise mkfifo() will return error**.  
It will generate 8 + 14 log files in your current working directory and output a  champion message from battle A‚Äôs stdout at the end of the championship.
Note that it does not mean you can get full points by successfully running with these two programs. We will check if you strictly follow the steps by checking the log files step by step.
